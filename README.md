## Quickstart

Management Portal can be easily run either by running from source or by using the provided `docker-compose` file.
### Using Docker-Compose

The quickest way to get ManagementPortal up and running in production mode is by using the included
docker-compose files. 
1. Make sure [Docker][] and [Docker-Compose][] are installed on your system.
2. Generate a key pair for signing JWT tokens as follows:
   ```shell
   keytool -genkey -alias selfsigned -keyalg RSA -keystore src/main/docker/etc/config/keystore.jks -keysize 4048 -storepass radarbase
   ```
3. Now, we can start the stack with `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/management-portal.yml up -d`.

This will start a Postgres database and ManagementPortal. The default password for the `admin`
account is `admin`.

### Build from source
you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine to run from source.
1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
3. Generate a key pair for signing JWT tokens as follows:
   ```shell
   keytool -genkey -alias selfsigned -keyalg RSA -keystore src/main/resources/config/keystore.jks -keysize 4048 -storepass radarbase
   ```
   **Make sure the key password and store password are the same!** This is a requirement for Spring Security.

4. **Profile configurations :** ManagementPortal can be run with either `development` or `production` profile. The table below lists the
main differences between the profiles are mentioned in the table below. Configure the application using the property file at `src/main/resources/config/application-<profile>.yml`.Read more about configurations [here](#configuration)
    
5. Run ManagementPortal by running `./gradlew bootRun -Pprod` or `./gradlew bootRun -Pdev`. Development mode will start an in
memory database and ManagementPortal. 
6. You can login to the application using `admin:admin`. Please don't forgot to change the password of `admin`, if you are using the application on production environment.

| Context path of the application  | `/`             | `/managementportal`               |




The docker image can be pulled by running `docker pull radarcns/management-portal:0.3.6

## Configuration

Management Portal comes with a set of default values for its configuration. You can either modify
the `application.yml` and `appliation-prod.yml` (or `application-dev.yml` when running the
development profile) before building the application, or override the defaults using environment
variables.

### Environment Variables

The table below lists the variables that are most likely in need of change when deploying Management
Portal. You can find the complete configuration
in the [application.yml](src/main/resources/config/application.yml) and 
[application-prod.yml](src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml) files. See
[Spring external configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html)
for other options on overriding the default configuration.

### OAuth Clients

ManagementPortal uses `OAuth2` workflow to provide authentication and authorization. To add new OAuth clients, you can add at runtime through the UI, or you can add them to the OAuth clients file
referenced by the `MANAGEMENTPORTAL_OAUTH_CLIENTS_FILE` configuration option.
- If your client is supposed to work with the `Pair app` feature, you need to set a key called `dynamic_registration` to `true` like this `{"dynamic_registration": true}` in its `additional_information` map. See the aRMT and pRMT
clients for an example. 
- If you want to prevent an OAuth client from being altered through the UI, you can add a key `{"protected": true}` in the `additional_information` map. 

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
3. Local SMTP server: currently a simple docker-compose is provided with a local SMTP server. Create `smtp.env` from `smtp.env.template` and modify `application.yml` accordingly.  

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    yarn install

We use yarn scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.


Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./gradlew
    yarn start

Then open <http://localhost:8080/> to start the interface and sign in with admin/admin.

[Yarn][] is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `yarn update` and `yarn install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `yarn help update`.

The `yarn run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    yarn add --exact leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    yarn add --dev --exact @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:

Edit [src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts](src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts) file:
~~~
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
~~~

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css](src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css) file:
~~~
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
~~~

Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### Using angular-cli

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts

## Building for production

To optimize the ManagementPortal application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootRepackage

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    yarn test

UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Protractor][], which is built on top of WebDriverJS. They're located in [src/test/javascript/e2e](src/test/javascript/e2e)
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`./gradlew bootRun`) and running the tests (`yarn run e2e`) in a second one.
### Other tests

Performance tests are run by [Gatling][] and written in Scala. They're located in [src/test/gatling](src/test/gatling) and can be run with:

    ./gradlew gatlingRun

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.
For example, to start a postgreSQL database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootRepackage -Pprod buildDocker

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`yo jhipster:docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.
## Documentation

Visit our [Github pages](https://radar-base.github.io/ManagementPortal) site to find links to the
Javadoc and API docs.

The pages site is published from the `gh-pages` branch, which has its own history. If you want to
contribute to the documentation, it is probably more convenient to clone a separate copy of this
repository for working on the `gh-pages` branch:
```bash
git clone --branch gh-pages https://github.com/RADAR-base/ManagementPortal.git ManagementPortal-docs
```
## Client libraries

This project provides a Gradle task to generate an [OpenAPI] specification from which client libraries can be automatically generated:
```bash
./gradlew generateOpenApiSpec
```
ManagementPortal needs to be running and be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` for this task to work.

The resulting file can be imported into the [Swagger editor], or used with [Swagger codegen] to generate client libraries. A Gradle task for generating a Java client is also provided for convenience:
```bash
./gradlew generateJavaClient
```
